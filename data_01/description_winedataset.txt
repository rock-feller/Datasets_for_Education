## Wine Quality Dataset
The Wine Quality Dataset involves predicting the quality of white wines on a scale given chemical measures of each wine.

It is a multi-class classification problem, (but it could also be framed as a regression problem). The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 4,898 observations with 11 input variables and one output variable. The variable names are as follows:

===================. Features Variables

Volatile acidity.
Citric acid.
Residual sugar.
Chlorides.
Free sulfur dioxide.
Total sulfur dioxide.
Density.
pH.
Sulphates.
